# Voice Assistant
The goal of voice assistant is to provide voice commands that can be used for minor operations during
work on PC, IDE or some other software

Trello board: https://trello.com/b/ZWo3bJ9n/voice-assistant

## Description
Voice assistant is supposed to be a part of Intellij IDEA part in role of plugin.
The idea is to create an extension that will contain english variants of primitive commands.
A developer will be able to use those commands by following way:
1) press and hold hot key
2) while the hot-key is pressed he says one short command
3) after a command is said he releases hot key
4) plugin gets this command and starts its processing
5) result of processing will be automatic execution of said command in borders of IDE and currently loaded project

Plugin must be aware of context. In terms of context each command will have a specific purpose.
TensorFlow framework is chosen for proof of concept.
